A relationship that is multi-valued in both directions is a many-to-many 
relationship. An breeder can have more than one dog, and a dog can have more 
than one breeder. 

This type of relationship is helped by the use of a linking table 
breed__breeder.

A user can have more than one match, a match has two breeders.
