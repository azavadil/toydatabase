one-to-many

identify the table representing the many side of the relationship and add the 
primary key of the one side table to it.

So in this instance many dogs belong to one breed therefore we add the field 
breed_id to the dog table and perform a table join on dog.breed_id = breed.id 
to retrieve dogs and their corresponding breed.
